# Delhi Delight Case Study using Decision Tree Algorithm
> We work at Delhi Delights! which is a food delivery company in Delhi. It offers a premium membership called ‘Delighted Members’, with which there is no delivery cost for your order. Lately, the number of purchases of this premium membership has been going down. Now, based on past data, Delhi Delights! wants to predict which of the customers will buy the 'Delighted Members' membership and which ones will not.
